# Spacing

Spirit UI provides a spacing system that can be used to help simplify the creation of components and page layouts.

## Scale

The spacing system is built on top of an 8px base unit.

The scale utilizes the base unit to create a set of spacing values that can be used to layout elements in a consistent way. Every spacing value on the scale is a multiple of the base unit and ranges from a multiple of x0 to a multiple of x10.

## Spacing Chart

Below is a table that highlights every spacing value and it's related token name, mulitple, rem value, pixel value, and a visualization of the space.
